# Social Media Platform Project

I'll create a full-stack social media application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) based on your project report. This will include user authentication, post creation, friend functionality, and a responsive UI with light/dark mode.

Thought for 8 secondsI'll create a full-stack social media platform using the MERN stack as specified in your project report. This will include all the required features like user authentication, post creation/editing, friend functionality, and light/dark mode.

## Project Overview

I've created a full-stack social media platform using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) as specified in your project report. This application follows a three-layered architecture with complete separation of concerns between the frontend and backend.

### Key Features

1. **User Authentication**

1. Registration with comprehensive validation
2. Profile image upload using React Dropzone
3. Secure login with JWT authentication
4. Password encryption with bcrypt



2. **User Interface**

1. Clean, responsive design that works on all screen sizes
2. Light and dark mode toggle
3. User profile widget showing personal details
4. Friend list with add/remove functionality



3. **Post Management**

1. Create posts with text and images
2. View news feed of all posts
3. Like and dislike posts
4. View and add comments
5. Delete posts (only by the creator)



4. **Friend Functionality**

1. Add and remove friends
2. View friend profiles
3. See friend lists of other users





### Technical Implementation

#### Frontend

- **React.js** as the framework
- **Redux Toolkit** for state management with Redux Persist for local storage
- **React Router** for navigation
- **Formik and Yup** for form validation
- **React Dropzone** for image uploads
- **Material UI** for styling components


#### Backend

- **Node.js** runtime environment
- **Express.js** as the backend framework
- **MongoDB** as the database
- **Mongoose** for database operations
- **JWT** for authentication
- **Multer** for file uploading


#### Database Schema

- User schema with fields for personal information, friends, and authentication
- Post schema with fields for content, likes, and comments


## How to Run the Project

1. **Set up the environment**

1. Create a `.env` file in the server directory based on the `.env.example` template
2. Add your MongoDB connection string and JWT secret



2. **Install dependencies**

```plaintext
# In the client directory
npm install

# In the server directory
npm install
```


3. **Start the servers**

```plaintext
# Start the backend server (from server directory)
npm start

# Start the frontend development server (from client directory)
npm start
```


4. **Access the application**

1. Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
2. Backend API: [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)





## Future Enhancements

As mentioned in your project report, future work could include:

- Real-time chat functionality
- Story sharing (24-hour content)
- Enhanced commenting features
- Related posts section
- Video upload support
- NLP for grouping similar posts
- Friend recommendation system
- Third-party authentication


This implementation provides a solid foundation that meets all the requirements specified in your project report while following best practices for MERN stack development.
